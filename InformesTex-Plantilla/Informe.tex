%% Version 7. Created January 2025.  
%%
%% AASTeX v7 calls the following external packages:
%% times, hyperref, ifthen, hyphens, longtable, xcolor, 
%% bookmarks, array, rotating, ulem, and lineno 
%%
%% RevTeX is no longer used in AASTeX v7.
%%
%% [MOD] s in .cls have been made. Look for them with the [MOD] tag.

\documentclass[preprint]{aastex7}
%%
%% This initial command takes arguments that can be used to easily modify 
%% the output of the compiled manuscript. Any combination of arguments can be 
%% invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument1,argument2,argument3,...]{aastex7}
%%
%% Six of the arguments are typestting options. They are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  default     : one text column, 10 point font, single spaced (default).
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default.
%%   linenumbers  : turn on linenumbering. Note this is mandatory for AAS
%%                  Journal submissions and revisions.
%%   trackchanges : Shows added text in bold.
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations, acknowledgments,
%%                  and author contributions for dual anonymous review.
%%  resetfootnote : Reset footnotes to 1 in the body of the manuscript.
%%                  Useful when there are a lot of authors and affiliations
%%		    in the front matter.
%%   longbib      : Print article titles in the references. This option
%% 		    is mandatory for PSJ manuscripts.
%%
%% Since v6, AASTeX has included \hyperref support. While we have built in 
%% specific %% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them 
%% with the \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% The "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.
%%
\newcommand{\vdag}{(v)^\dagger}
\newcommand\aastex{AAS\TeX}
\newcommand\latex{La\TeX}

% ================================================ AUTHORS =====================================================
%% A significant change from AASTeX v6+ is in the author blocks. Now an email
%% address is required for each author. This means that each author requires
%% at least one of the following:
%%
%% \author
%% \affiliation
%% \email
%%
%% If these three commands are not available for each author, the latex
%% compiler will issue an error and if you force the latex compiler to continue,
%% it will generate an incomplete pdf.
%%
%% Multiple \affiliation commands are allowed and authors can also include
%% an optional \altaffiliation to indicate a status, i.e. Hubble Fellow. 
%% while affiliations are indexed as footnotes, altaffiliations are noted with
%% with a non-numeric footnote that is set away from the numeric \affiliation 
%% footnotes. NOTE that if an \altaffiliation command is used it must 
%% come BEFORE the \affiliation call, right after the \author command, in 
%% order to place the footnotes in the proper location. Because non-numeric
%% symbols are used, \altaffiliation should be used sparingly.
%%
%% In v7 the \author command takes an optional argument which provides 
%% additional metadata about the author. Authors can provide the 16 digit 
%% ORCID, the surname (family or last) name, the given (first or fore-) name, 
%% and a name suffix, e.g. "Jr.". The syntax is:
%%
%% \author[orcid=0000-0002-9072-1121,gname=Gregory,sname=Schwarz]{Greg Schwarz}
%%
%% This name metadata in not shown, it is only for parsing by the peer review
%% system so authors can be more easily identified. This name information will
%% also be sent to the publisher so they can include it in the CROSSREF 
%% metadata. Including an orcid will hyperlink the author name to the 
%% author's ORCID page. Note that  during compilation, LaTeX will do some 
%% limited checking of the format of the ID to make sure it is valid. If 
%% the "orcid-ID.png" image file is  present or in the LaTeX pathway, the 
%% ORCID icon will appear next to the authors name.
%%
%% Even though emails are now required for each author, the \email does not
%% produce output in the compiled manuscript unless the optional "show" command
%% is used. For example,
%%
%% \email[show]{greg.schwarz@aas.org}
%%
%% All "shown" emails are show in the bottom left of the first page. Due to
%% space constraints, only a few emails should be shown. 
%%
%% To identify a corresponding author, use the \correspondingauthor command.
%% The command appends "Corresponding Author: " to the argument it appears at
%% the bottom left of the first page like the output from \email. 

% \input{Config/authors.tex}

% \collaboration{all}{The Terra Mater collaboration}

%% Use the \collaboration command to identify collaborations. This command
%% takes an optional argument that is either a number or the word "all"
%% which tells the compiler how many of the authors above the command to
%% show. For example "\collaboration[all]{(DELVE Collaboration)}" wil include
%% all the authors above this command.
%%
%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 

\def\abstractname{RESÚMEN}
\input{Pages/Doc/abstract.tex}

% ================================================ KEYWORDS ====================================================
\input{Config/keywords.tex}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% Please use the acknowledgment and contribution environments. This will 
%% be anonomyized when the "anonymous" style option is used.

% \input{Pages/Doc/contribution.tex}

% ============================================== FACILITIES ====================================================
%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their 
%% telescopes the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope 
%% facilities.
%
%% Following the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} or \facilities{} macros to list the keywords of facilities used 
%% in the research for the paper.  Each keyword is check against the master 
%% list during copy editing.  Individual instruments can be provided in 
%% parentheses, after the keyword, but they are not verified.

\facilities{OUC (Santa Martina)}

% ================================================ SOFTWARE ====================================================
%% Similar to \facility{}, there is the optional \software command to allow 
%% authors a place to specify which programs were used during the creation of 
%% the manuscript. Authors should list each code and include either a
%% citation or url to the code inside ()s when available.
\software{Siril \citep{Richard2024},
          Stellarium \citep{Zotti_Wolf_2022},
          \texttt{tikz3dtools} \citep{tikz3dtools},
          }

% ============================================== APENDIX ======================================================
%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.
%%
%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc. The
%% Figure and Table counter will not reset.

%%
%% pdflatex sample7.tex
%% bibtext sample7
%% pdflatex sample7.tex
%% pdflatex sample7.tex

\bibliography{Informe}{}
\bibliographystyle{Config/NoMod/aasjournalv7.bst}

%% This command is needed to show the entire author+affiliation list when
%% the collaboration and author truncation commands are used.  It has to
%% go at the end of the manuscript.
%\allauthors

%% Include this line if you are using the \added, \replaced, \deleted
%% commands to see a summary list of all changes at the end of the article.
