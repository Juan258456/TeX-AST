\section{Revision tracking and color highlighting} \label{sec:highlight}

The {\tt\string\added\{<text>\}} command should be used to highlight new text in bold for revised manuscripts. To activate this command, the {\tt\string trackchanges} option must be used in the {\tt\string\documentclass} call.  When compiled this will produce the marked text in bold font. Take out the {\tt\string trackchanges} option if you want the bold to disappear.

\added{This text was specifically added to feature this reborn functionality. Notice how the bold goes away when you remove the 'trackfeatures' option.}
